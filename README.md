# Unicorn Sounds

A new kind of baby monitor using Raspberry Pi and the beautiful [Unicorn HAT HD from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat-hd).

## Requirements
### Hardware
- 2 x Raspberry Pi (with wireless). One is the listener (server), one is the display (client)
- 1 x USB mic
- Unicorn HAT HD

### Software
- Raspbian is recommended (but greater than Wheezy for Unicorn HAT HD)
- Git
- Python 3

All packages are installed with:

```bash
sudo pip3 install -r unicorn_sounds/
requirements.pip
```
